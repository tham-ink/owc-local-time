extention so i dont have to keep converting the fuckass utc to pst why cant they just have this on the website already man

how to install:

1. download and unzip
2. go to your browser's extention page and enable developer mode
3. press "load unpacked" and select folder
4. refresh the owc page and they should b there

if theres problems dm me on discord (tham.ink) and i probably might not fix it
